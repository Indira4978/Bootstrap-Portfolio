# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Portfolio created with Bootstrap.

For the week 3 challenge, I was tasked to create a web page for my portfolio, using Bootstrap and newly developped skills related to HTML and CSS.

Some key features are : 

- navbar at the top of the page, containing links leading to the relevant sections of the page 
- a Jumbotron with my profile picture or avatar
- a work section created with cards
- buttons with shadow effects
- hover effect on hyperlinks

# I used several resources to build the page, including: 
- https://www.w3schools.com/
- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/
- CodeCademy 
- YouTube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qfEOE4vtxE&t=2637s
